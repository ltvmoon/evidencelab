## Introduction

![Evidence Lab](ui/frontend/public/docs/images/evidence-lab.png)

Evidence Lab is a free open source platform that provides a document pipeline, search, and AI-powered information discovery tools. The aim is to provide a quick start for those looking to use AI with their documents and a place where new ideas can be tested.

You can run the code yourself, or explore the online version at [evidencelab.ai](https://evidencelab.ai) which has so far been populated with about 20,000 United Nations humanitarian evaluation reports sourced from the [United Nations Evaluation Group](https://www.un.org/evaluations). See [Data](ui/frontend/public/docs/data.md) for more information on these amazing documents.

If you would like to have your public documents added to Evidence Lab, or would like to contribute to the project, please reach out to [evidencelab@astrobagel.com](mailto:evidencelab@astrobagel.com).

## Philosophy

Evidence Lab grew out of research work for the [AstroBagel Blog](https://medium.com/@astrobagel). The core design principles are:

* **Runs on a desktop** — the full pipeline can process 20,000 30-page documents in a week for less than $50
* **Configurable** — point it at a folder of PDFs and configure via a single `config.json`
* **Progressive complexity** — start with simple parsing and layer on richer features (image annotation, reranking) later without re-processing
* **Model-agnostic** — supports both open-source and proprietary embedding and LLM models
* **Observable** — built-in tools for monitoring pipeline progress and exploring AI retrieval quality

Some lofty, often conflicting, goals! Always a work in progress, and low-cost high-speed processing which runs on a desktop computer, does come with a few shortcuts. To run on a modest server, the user interface might not be the fastest out there (but can be if you add more processing power), and in not using expensive LLMs for parsing (only cheap ones!), the ingestion had to be tuned to the document data styles. That said, the design has tried to allow for future improvements.

## Features

Evidence Lab document processing pipeline includes the following features:

1. Processing pipeline

- PDF/Word parsing with Docling, to include document structure detection
- Footnote and references, images and table detection
- Basic table extraction, with support for more expensive processing as required
- AI-assisted document summarization
- AI-assisted tagging of documents
- Indexing with Open (Huggingface) or proprietary models (Azure foundry, but extensible)

2. User interface

- Hybrid search with AI summary and reranking
- Field boosting — detects countries/organizations in the query and promotes matching results; at full weight, non-matching results are excluded
- Experimental features such as heatmapper for tracking trends in content
- Filtering by metadata, in-document section types
- Search and reranking settings to explore different models
- Auto min score filtering using percentile-based thresholding (filters bottom 30% of results)
- Semantic highlighting in search results
- Basic language translation
- PDF preview with in-document search
- Administration views to track pipeline, documents, performance and errors

More features will be added soon, focused on document evidence analysis.

## Getting started

You can explore the hosted version at [evidencelab.ai](https://evidencelab.ai).

### Quick Start

1. **Configure data sources**
   - Edit [`config.json`](config.json) in the repo root to define `datasources`, `data_subdir`, `field_mapping`, and `taxonomies`.
   - The UI reads the same `config.json` via Docker Compose.

2. **Set environment variables**
   - Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env`.
   - Fill in the API keys and service URLs required by the pipeline and UI.

3. **Add documents + metadata**
   - Save documents under `data/<data_subdir>/pdfs/<organization>/<year>/`.
   - For each document, include a JSON metadata file with the same base name.
   - If a download failed, add a `.error` file with the same base name (scanner records these).

   Example layout:
   ```
   data/
     uneg/
       pdfs/
         UNDP/
           2024/
             report_123.pdf
             report_123.json
             report_124.error (if there was an error downloading the file)
   ```

4. **Run the pipeline (Docker)**
   ```bash
   # Start services
   docker compose up -d --build

   # Run the orchestrator (example: UNEG)
   docker compose exec pipeline \
     python -m pipeline.orchestrator --data-source uneg --skip-download --num-records 10
   ```

   > **Tip:** To quickly ingest a single test document and verify the full stack,
   > run the integration test script instead:
   > ```bash
   > ./tests/integration/run_integration_host_pipeline.sh
   > ```
   > This ingests a sample report, rebuilds the containers, and runs the
   > integration test suite end-to-end.

5. **Access the Evidence Lab UI**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Select your data source and search the indexed documents

6. **Next steps**
   - See the technical deep dive for pipeline commands, downloaders, and architecture details:

   - See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup, pre-commit hooks,
     testing, and contribution guidelines
